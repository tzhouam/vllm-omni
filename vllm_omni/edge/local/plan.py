"""Decide where a text session runs, and be able to say why -- before loading.

This is the M0 deliverable the proposal calls "一个可审计的 Omni 本地文本模式":
a plan that names the device, the backend, every byte it intends to reserve and
the evidence class of each claim, and that **refuses explicitly** when no
combination works. Refusing is a first-class outcome here, not an exception on
the way to one.

Two refusals are worth naming because they are the reason this module exists
rather than a ``try: load()``:

*The format refusal.* ``models/Spark-X2.5-1.7B-int8`` is 1.9 GB and the card
has 24 GiB, so every capacity check passes. It still cannot run: cutlass has no
int8 ``scaled_mm`` for SM >= 100 and vLLM's dispatch raises in the first
forward. Without this module you find out after ~40 s of engine startup, from a
stack trace in a subprocess. With it you find out in 30 ms, from a sentence
that names the remedy.

*The capacity refusal.* ``Spark-X2.5-4B`` is 7.66 GiB of weights, and the
budget it needs is not 7.66 GiB -- it is weights plus the KV cache for the
context you asked for plus activations plus the loader's transient plus a
margin. Sizing that from ``free VRAM`` at load time is what the proposal's
section 6.2 calls out: the number to check is the sum over the session's
lifetime, formed before anything allocates.

**What is measured and what is arithmetic.** The weight bytes are read off the
files (D). The KV/state bytes come from
:func:`vllm_omni.edge.kv_budget.kv_budget_for`, which reads the real
``layer_types`` rather than charging every layer full length (E, exact
arithmetic on a documented layout). Activations, workspace and the load
transient are **estimates** (E) from the constants below, and they are
deliberately generous: this module's job is to be a safe upper bound that
refuses before an OOM, not to predict the peak.

The estimates are checked rather than believed:
:meth:`vllm_omni.edge.local.engine.LocalTextEngine.measured_peak` reports the
budgeted peak against the sampled one after every run, so a budget that is
wildly off is visible in the record instead of surviving as a constant nobody
re-examined. On Spark-X2.5-4B at a 4096 context this budget is 12.51 GiB
against a measured 8.93 GiB attributable peak -- 1.40x, i.e. safe and loose,
which is the intended direction.
