"""The wire between the engine and a stage that runs in another process.

Deliberately tiny, and deliberately **stdlib + numpy only**. The worker on the
other end of this socket may be a native-Windows interpreter that has no torch,
no vllm and no vllm_omni on its path -- ``C:\\Users\\zhout\\npu-ep`` is exactly
that: Python 3.12, onnxruntime, onnx, numpy, nothing else. Anything imported
here has to be installable there, so this module imports neither.

**Why a socket at all.** Two devices on this laptop cannot be reached from the
engine's own interpreter, and for different reasons:

* the **XDNA2 NPU** is an MCDM device. WSL2's GPU-PV forwards WDDM display
  adapters only, so there is no ``/dev/accel`` inside WSL and no amount of
  installing changes that. VitisAI is a Windows DLL.
* the **Radeon 890M** is reachable from WSL through DirectML, but
  ``torch-directml`` pins torch 2.4.1 and Omni runs 2.13.

So out-of-process is forced, not preferred. One protocol covers both, plus the
native-Windows DirectML route, which needs its own venv anyway because
``onnxruntime-directml`` is pinned at 1.24.4 and cannot load the VitisAI EP
(that needs ORT >= 1.25) -- the two AMD devices cannot share an interpreter.

**Framing.** ``[4-byte big-endian header length][JSON header][raw tensor bytes]``.
Tensors are described in the header (name, dtype, shape, nbytes) and their
buffers are concatenated after it in the order listed, so a receive is two
reads and one ``frombuffer`` per tensor -- no per-element work and no pickle.
Measured on this machine, WSL <-> native Windows: 11 us half round trip,
330 MB/s. That is ample for a stage boundary (a 2 s Code2Wav chunk is ~192 KB,
about 0.6 ms) and nowhere near enough for per-layer traffic inside a decode
loop, which is the arithmetic behind "coarse stages only".

``pickle`` is not used anywhere in here on purpose: the header is JSON, the
payload is raw buffers, so a hostile or merely broken peer cannot execute code
by replying.
